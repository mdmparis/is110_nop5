Evolutionary history of the IS110 recombinase and the NOP5/NOP56/NOP58 proteins. 


# Repository
- `data/` contains the raw data used for this project (initial sequences, profile HMM and AlphaFold structures)
- `dev/is110` `dev/nop5` and `dev/prp31/` contain the results of homology detection using iterative profile HMM search against our database of genomes. 
- `dev/n_ter_domain/` and `dev/c_ter_domain` contain the per domain analysis (homology detection and phylogenetic tree)
- `dev/concat_phylo` contains the phylogenetic using the concatenated per domain alignments.
- `dev/phylo_prp31_nop5/` contains the phylogenetic analysis for Nop5/56/58 and Prp31 on their Nop domain.
